    <p>The <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/268091/easy-korean-ground-beef-bowl/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AllRecipes</a> contributor who came up with this recipe said: <i>"This delicious Korean beef bowl is quick and easy to make with ground beef. It's seasoned with fresh ginger, garlic, soy, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper, but these ingredients can easily be adjusted to suit your taste. Serve over warm rice or spiralized vegetables."</i></p>
    <p>Even though the ingredient list is a bit too long for my taste, with a prep time of 10 minutes and with only 15 minutes to cook, I can't resist this simple and easy recipe and I believe you won't either!</p>
